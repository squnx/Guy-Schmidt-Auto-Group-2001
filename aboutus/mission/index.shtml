		  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Guy Schmidt Automotive Group it's our people who make the difference!
		  Family owned and operated for 2 generations (since 1971 in the same location). Let us sell you a car or truck, family to family!  We are talking employees and employers!
		  Our technicians have been trained by General Motors and are educated regularly to keep current with new factory specifications. Our people have many years of experience (i.e., our service advisors have over 114 years in the business).
		  People that like their jobs and stick around are people who do good work. They also strive to build relationships with customers. In fact 43% of our business is repeat business.  And that's what this is all about!<BR>
		  <IMG SRC="/images/shim.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="10"><BR>
		  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Guy Schmidt Automotive Group, our Owner is on the premises! No one has to call Detroit or the corporate headquarters somewhere in the Midwest to make a decision or solve a problem. Our Managers are empowered to make decisions.
		  Should the need arise you can call, Mr. M. Jean Vaughn, yourself, directly at (818) 553-3030! Come on in and see for yourself!<BR>

		  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We'd love to sell you a car or truck, family to family at the Best Price! Then continue the relationship as a friend and neighbor by giving the Best Service for the life of that vehicle. . . in the hope that you'll come back to us again and again.
		  It's an old concept - but we believe it's the Best Way to do business! And we sincerely believe you will too!<BR><BR></TD>
